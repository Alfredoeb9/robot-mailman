# Robo-Mailman

This is a robot mailman that will be moving around the village. There are parcels in various places, each addressed to some other place.
The robot picks up parcel when it comes across them and delivers them when it arrives at their destinations.

The automaton must decide, at each point, where to go next. It has finished its task when all parcels have been delivered.
